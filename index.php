 <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Welcome to Recovery at the 
Unity Club</h1>
<td>
<img src="images/ImageHandler(3).ashx"></td>
<td> is a 12-Step club where newcomers are eagerly embraced by the guys and gals who’re already working "The Program".  Whatever program, or fellowship, you’re attending(We host 16 of them at the moment), you’re sure to find a few folks willing to assist with your recovery, as you assist with theirs.  It will make sense later, trust us just for a bit.

Broke and new to recovery, Don A. perhaps says it best, "I came to my first meeting on Sunday.  An hour-and-a-half later I was still broke, but had an experienced sponsor, a Big Book, and hope.  I surely had some hope."<br>

That's how it is around here.  This is a place of hope, change, and opportunity to recover.  This is where we "Carry the Message" to those still suffering.  This is the Unity Club.</td>
<br><b>What You'll Find In this New Unity Club System:</h3></b>

<B>*</B>Our SYSTEM is fairly simple.  The "beef" is our <b>*</b>meeting schedule, surprisingly enough, found under "meetings" on the Timetable Schedule. You can also find <b>*</b>information about special events and leasing the Club under meetings as well.<br>

The second most popular part of our SYSTEM is how to get here.  As if by magic, found under "Directions".

And so on and so forth.  Explore, have fun.  Become a member <b>*</b>(although membership is NOT required to attend meetings).  DONATE money so that we can continue our noble pursuits of providing a safe, <b>*</b>secure environment for recovery while we "Carry the Message".

Even in the event that you cannot find what you're looking for, in this SYSTEM site, then chances are <b>*</b>(if it is 12-Step Recovery info you're after) that we have links to it in our links section.</td>
